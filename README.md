# Deni Design System 🎨✨

Welcome to the Deni Design System, where creativity meets chaos in the realm of UI components. Built with Vite, React, and Storybook, because who needs conventional when you can have quirky?

## Features 🚀

- **Vite**: Lightning-Fast
- **React**: Life's too short for vanilla JS.
- **Storybook**: Where every component gets its 5 minutes of fame.

## What's Inside? 🎁

- **Custom Components**: At the moment there are only two components and some pink colors.
<!-- - **Unicorn-powered UI**: Adding sparkle to your apps, one component at a time. -->

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️💨

### Prerequisites 📋

- **Node.js** (version >= 14.0.0)
- **npm** or **yarn** (because choices are great, aren't they?)
